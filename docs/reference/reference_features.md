# Reference Features

Geoconnex uses reference features to standardize references to the same real-world things such as watersheds, monitoring locations, or counties. 

These features can be found at https://reference.geoconnex.us/ and a guide to use reference feature data can be found in the [`Access Data` tab](../access/reference/)

## Submitting Changes to Reference Features

The Geoconnex system uses persistent identifiers, also known as PIDs. These associate a feature with a static number so that one can change the name or details of a feature without breaking associated links.
