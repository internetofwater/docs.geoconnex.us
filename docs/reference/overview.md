# Overview

Geoconnex development is guided by the [spatial data on the web best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp) put forth by W3C and OGC.

## Governance and Feedback

- All Geoconnex material, including these docs and ideas on best practices more generally are open to public discussions via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us/issues) or email
- The Geoconnex working group, which is open membership, considers issues and advises the technical implementors of Geoconnex from the consensus of its quarterly meetings

## Best Practices Links

Throughout the Geoconnex docs you can find both descriptions of general best practices that guide Geoconnex development as well as their concrete implementation for how they are used in practice.
