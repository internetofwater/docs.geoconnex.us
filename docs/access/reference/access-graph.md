# Accessing Data from the Graph

The Geoconnex Graph enables the discovery of datasets linked to geospatial features, including reference features such as mainstems. One of the key sections to explore when accessing a feature's HTML page is the `datasets` section, which provides valuable information about related monitoring locations and measurements.

## Understanding the Datasets Section

The `datasets` section contains records of various datasets associated with the feature you are exploring. These datasets often represent monitoring locations or other observational data, and they provide key information to help you understand the environmental or hydrological characteristics of the area.

### Key Attributes in the Datasets Section

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Monitoring Location | Links to the URL of a specific monitoring location, such as a sensor or station that collects environmental data. |
| Site Name | The identifier or name of the monitoring site. It typically includes a unique code or description of the location. |
| Dataset Description | Provides a summary of the dataset, often including the type of data being collected (e.g., discharge, water level, temperature) and any relevant metadata. |
| Variable Measured | The type of variable being observed, such as discharge, water temperature, or precipitation. |
| Measurement Technique | Describes how the variable is being measured, providing insight into the methods or instruments used to gather data. |
| Temporal Coverage | The time range for which the data is available. This attribute defines the start and end times of the dataset's observation period. |
