# Querying with Python

[HyRiver](https://docs.hyriver.io/) provides a wrapper over Geoconnex and allows for queries by spatial areas, by ID, and using CQL filters. Documentation for using HyRiver with Geoconnex can be found [here](https://docs.hyriver.io/examples/notebooks/geoconnex.html).

A general purpose Geoconnex query API for Python is not yet released but is planned to be eventually supported.
