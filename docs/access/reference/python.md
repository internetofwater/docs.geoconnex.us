# Querying with Python

[HyRiver](https://docs.hyriver.io/) provides a wrapper over Geoconnex and allows for queries by spatial areas, by ID, and using CQL filters. Documentation for using HyRiver with Geoconnex can be found [here](https://docs.hyriver.io/examples/notebooks/geoconnex.html).

Since the Geoconnex reference feature server uses pygeoapi to implement the OGC API - Features specification, you can also query it directly in a standardized way. The openapi specification for which queries are valid can be found [here](https://reference.geoconnex.us/openapi)
